## Start Development Environment

To start the development environment, simply install docker and run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

Note that the Command will not work, if the Docker daemon is not running.


After a couple of minutes of installing and compiling, the localhost development server should be reachable under `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Plattform specific notes:

On MacOS the Docker Desktop application must be started to start the Docker daemon.
